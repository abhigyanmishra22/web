                    <p>Dear Students <br>
                        <br>
                        Welcome to the DDUC parivar.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Higher Education does not simply mean an arithmetic progression from Class XII to an
                        Undergraduate Programme. It means,
                        a qualitative leap into matured thinking, responsible conduct and taking charge of one’s career
                        and life ahead. It is a
                        leap not onto a stepping-stone but onto a path of lifelong learning. In the three-year time that
                        you will spend here,
                        our endeavour shall be to usher you to this path. So, look forward to an exciting year and
                        fulfilling and fulfilled stay
                        at the college.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        You will be the first batch of a three-year choice based-credit system of undergraduate studies.
                        This is a nation-wide,
                        uniform curriculum implemented by the University Grants Commission. The underlying spirit has
                        been to facilitate
                        inter-university migration and transfer of academic credits. Thus, if you choose or need to
                        migrate to some other
                        university within India and eventually abroad during the currency of a programme, you will be
                        able to do so and take
                        your credits earned along. You will not have to start afresh. The word ‘choice’ implies the
                        doing away with the
                        rigidities of a fixed curriculum. You shall have a bouquet of papers to choose from and design,
                        as if it were, your own
                        subject combinations from your own core discipline, other disciplines and skill based courses.
                        We shall handhold you in
                        making the right choices.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Managing transition, however, is not easy. We have learnt this art through successful transition
                        from annual to the
                        semester mode, from a three-year to a four-year and back to three-year undergraduate programme.
                        To facilitate the
                        transition further, we are embarking on a student-mentoring programme with a view to attending
                        to your scholastic,
                        coscholastic and extra-curricular -activity related needs and requirements. We have designed an
                        academic calendar too,
                        that we shall be duly unveiling. During the upcoming year we shall also be relocated to our new
                        campus at Dwarka. It
                        shall be our collective responsibility to ensure that our migration to the new locality and
                        transition to the new
                        building is smooth.
