    <h4 align="center">PLOT</h4>
    <p>Over 30 years after graduating from Top Gun,[a] United States Navy Captain Pete "Maverick" Mitchell is a test
        pilot.
        Despite Maverick's many distinguished achievements, repeated insubordination has kept him from flag rank.[b] His
        friend
        and former Top Gun rival, Admiral Tom "Iceman" Kazansky, is commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet and often
        protects
        Maverick from being grounded. Rear Admiral Chester "Hammer" Cain plans to shut down Maverick's "Darkstar"
        scramjet
        program in favor of funding drones. <br>

        <br>To save the program from cancellation, Maverick changes the flight plan in the upcoming test from Mach 9 to
        Mach 10 to
        meet the program's contract specification. The prototype is destroyed, however, when Maverick pushes beyond Mach
        10.
        Iceman again saves Maverick's career by ordering him to NAS North Island for his next assignment, but Hammer
        warns
        Maverick that the era of crewed fighter aircraft will soon end.<br>

        <br>The Navy has been tasked with destroying an unsanctioned uranium enrichment plant, which sits in a deep
        depression at
        the end of a canyon. It is defended by SA-3 Goa surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), GPS jammers, and what appear to
        be
        fifth-generation Sukhoi Su-57[c] fighters. Maverick devises a plan to attack with two pairs of F/A-18E/F Super
        Hornets.
        He learns that he will not take part in the strike; instead, he is to train an elite group of Top Gun graduates
        assembled by Air Boss Vice Admiral Beau "Cyclone" Simpson.<br>
        <br>
        In the film, Maverick confronts his past while training a group of younger Top Gun graduates, including the son
        of his
        deceased best friend, for a dangerous mission.
